In **C# Clean Architecture**, different layers of the application have distinct responsibilities, and it’s important to manage the lifetime of the services in each layer appropriately. Clean Architecture typically divides an application into the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI)** – This is where user interactions take place.
2. **Application Layer** – This layer handles use cases and application logic.
3. **Domain Layer** – This is the core business logic of the application, containing entities, value objects, and domain services.
4. **Infrastructure Layer** – This layer handles interactions with external systems (e.g., databases, file systems, APIs).

Each of these layers may require different **Dependency Injection (DI) lifetimes** depending on how the services are used and how state is managed.

### **Common Dependency Injection Lifetimes in C#**
In **C# (ASP.NET Core)**, there are three primary lifetimes for services that are registered in the DI container:

- **Transient** (`AddTransient<TService, TImplementation>`): A new instance is created every time the service is requested.
- **Scoped** (`AddScoped<TService, TImplementation>`): A single instance is created per **HTTP request** (or per unit of work).
- **Singleton** (`AddSingleton<TService, TImplementation>`): A single instance is created and shared for the lifetime of the application.

### **Lifetime Usage for Each Layer in Clean Architecture**

Let’s go over the appropriate lifetime for each layer based on their responsibilities:

---

### **1. Presentation Layer (UI)**

This layer typically handles user interactions (e.g., web API controllers, MVC controllers, or a Blazor UI). These services are often **short-lived** because they are tightly coupled to the request/response cycle or the user session.

#### Appropriate Lifetimes:
- **Scoped**: Controllers or UI-related services should generally be **scoped** to the **HTTP request**, as each request should be processed independently, and the controller’s lifetime should be tied to the request lifecycle.
  - **Reason**: The controller processes one request at a time, and scoped services are created and disposed of with each request.

#### Example:
```csharp
services.AddScoped<MyController>();
```

---

### **2. Application Layer**

The **Application Layer** contains the use cases or application services that orchestrate the flow of data between the UI and the domain. These services are typically **stateless** but need to perform business logic using domain models, interact with repositories, etc.

#### Appropriate Lifetimes:
- **Scoped**: The application services (such as handlers for use cases, commands, or queries) should typically be **scoped**.
  - **Reason**: These services are designed to be tied to a single **request** or **transaction**. They often interact with domain services or repositories and should be disposed of after the work is completed.
  
#### Example:
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();
```

- **Transient**: If you have very lightweight services that don’t hold any significant state and can be created and disposed of quickly, you might opt for **transient** services in the application layer.
  - **Reason**: These services may represent small, stateless operations like request handlers for simple use cases or services with no significant state that don’t require scoping.

#### Example:
```csharp
services.AddTransient<IRequestHandler<CreateProductCommand, Result>, CreateProductHandler>();
```

---

### **3. Domain Layer**

The **Domain Layer** is the heart of Clean Architecture. It contains the core business logic, such as entities, aggregates, value objects, domain services, and business rules. The domain layer is usually **purely functional**, with no dependencies on external systems or infrastructure.

#### Appropriate Lifetimes:
- **Singleton** or **Transient**: Domain services and entities are typically stateless and immutable. As a result:
  - **Singleton** can be used for **domain services** that are pure and stateless, as they are designed to be shared across the entire application without issue.
  - **Transient** is often a good choice for **domain logic** that needs to be created every time but doesn’t need to persist state.

#### Example:
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IDomainService, DomainService>();
```

- **Note**: You should **never** register domain models like entities (e.g., `Product`, `Order`) as services in the DI container, because they are not services but simply objects that represent business data. Entities are typically instantiated as needed within the domain logic.

---

### **4. Infrastructure Layer**

The **Infrastructure Layer** deals with external systems, such as databases, file systems, external APIs, and any other system the application depends on. These services usually require **longer lifetimes** because they might need to maintain a connection pool, manage state, or perform expensive I/O operations.

#### Appropriate Lifetimes:
- **Scoped**: Services that interact with a database (e.g., repositories) should be **scoped**. The reason for scoping is that many of these services are tied to a single **unit of work**, like a database transaction or an HTTP request. For instance, repositories that use an `Entity Framework` `DbContext` are typically scoped.
  - **Reason**: Databases and HTTP requests are often tied to a specific scope, and the lifetime of repository objects should be limited to the duration of a request or transaction.

#### Example:
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();
```

- **Singleton**: Infrastructure components that are **stateless** or should be shared across the entire application (e.g., caching services, logging services, API clients) are often **singleton**.
  - **Reason**: These services should be shared across all requests and should be instantiated only once for the entire lifetime of the application.

#### Example:
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, CacheService>();
```

### Summary of Differences:

| **Lifetime**     | **Description**                                             | **When to Use**                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Transient**    | New instance is created every time it is requested.         | Stateless, lightweight services.             |
| **Scoped**       | One instance per HTTP request or per scope.                 | Services that need to be shared within a single request (e.g., database context). |
| **Singleton**    | Single instance shared throughout the application's lifetime. | Shared, global resources (e.g., logging, configuration). |
| **SingletonInstance** | Pre-created instance used as a Singleton.                  | When you already have an instance you want to use as a Singleton. |

### **Summary of Recommended Lifetimes by Layer**:


| **Layer**               | **Recommended Lifetime**         | **Explanation**                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Presentation Layer**   | **Scoped**                       | Tied to HTTP requests; disposable after each request.                  |
| **Application Layer**    | **Scoped** or **Transient**      | Tied to the lifecycle of the request or transaction.                   |
| **Domain Layer**         | **Singleton** or **Transient**   | Pure, stateless logic that is either shared across requests (Singleton) or transient (stateless). |
| **Infrastructure Layer** | **Scoped** (for DB access) or **Singleton** (for services like caching, logging) | Scoped for stateful interactions (e.g., repositories) or singleton for stateless services (e.g., logging, caching). |

### **Conclusion**

- **Scoped** lifetime is the most commonly used in Clean Architecture, as it ensures that each HTTP request or unit of work gets its own instance of services, without leaking or overusing resources.
- **Singleton** is suitable for stateless, long-lived services that should be shared across the application (e.g., caching or logging).
- **Transient** is appropriate for lightweight services or use cases that don’t require shared state and are instantiated each time they are requested.

Each layer in Clean Architecture should use the appropriate lifetime based on whether the services are stateless or require resource management (like database connections or HTTP requests), and this ensures better scalability, maintainability, and testability.
